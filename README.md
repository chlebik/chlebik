### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

It's really nice to have a space to write a little bit more here. Simple *status like* motto under the picture is not enough. This profile is quite old - I've been using it to access contents of other's repositories, give stars and such. 

Pinned repositories are the ones specifically recommended for everybody, as they incorporate the knowledge I've gained along the way, and want to share with others. They come from various places in the IT land, representing shifts in my approach to my progress and interests. So far there are three of them - let's hope there will be more.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently (re)learning **modern cloud and data engineering landscape technologies**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **everything I could be of help. I'll try to answer as best as I can!**
- âš¡ Fun fact: **Chlebik** means *small bread* in Polish.
